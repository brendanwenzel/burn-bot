# Slingshot Burn Bot

The "Slingshot Burn Bot" is similar to the well-known "Bobby Buy Bot" except instead of posting new buys, the burn bot will post new burn events for the token.

There are two ways to use this bot.

1. Contact the Slingshot team in the [Slingshot Telegram](https://t.me/slingshotportal) and we can add your project to our already running bot at no cost to your project.
2. Clone this repo and make the necessary adjustments. We only ask that you consider buying and burning some [$SLING](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x2c43f5288a9a64cbebe39070e6f65f582f7c7433) to help our project grow.

## Using the Bot

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Run the Telegram bot:

```bash
node index.js
```
